						<h4>What's it aw aboot?</h4>
						<p>Having stumbled upon a few clips of walking football on YouTube, it was decided that Arbroath could be doing with this. Local man Jim decided to enlist the help of Mike. They were both still keen on playing, but just didn't have the stamina and pace that they had a 'few' years ago. </p>
						<p>They contacted some of the guys who they used to play with to see if there was an interest in it, and there was. Next, the venue had to be found, Arbroath high school sport centre was ideal, and the staff there couldn't have been more helpful. They have a large astroturf ptch that is also divided into 4 pitches that are ideal for 6 or 7 a-side games. The first few games were hard going, most found it hard not to run, and passes were played too far in front. Since then, the players have sussed it out. Watch the video on this page to see a clip of the standard.</p>
