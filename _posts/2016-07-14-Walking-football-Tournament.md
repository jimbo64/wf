![Walking football tournament](/assets/wft-algarve.jpg)

We have (via this website) been invited to a walking football tournament in the Algarve. Aye, You read that right, the Algarve.<!--more-->
I can give the brief details, but I fully recommend downloading the document with the full details, I'll put the link at the end of this post.


- The tournament will Take place between 5th and 9th of October 2016.


- It's a 5-a-side tournament.


- Group stage is round Robin, then quarter and semi finals, then the final.


Please read on, don't let the dates put you off.


The tournament games will be played on the 5-a-side 3G pitch located among the other on-site sporting and leisure facilities including Tennis Courts, Indoor and Outdoor Pool, 1.1km cross-country running track, and sauna. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all included in thetournament package and will be served in one of the on-site restaurants with a BBQ meal at the end of the tournament. This is family friendly, you are more than welcome to bring your partner or any other family member.

My suggestion (and it's only a suggestion) is that we wait until next year. If people so wish, they can start putting money away via the club treasurer (Mike Muir).
