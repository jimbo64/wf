Trip to Algarve etc.

For anyone interested in going the to the walking football tournament in the Algarve next October, from this coming Wednesday (28-09-2016) We will be giving players the option to start putting money aside for it.<!--more--> You don't need to put money aside with the club, but if you are interested in going, please let us know.

After having a look around, it was noted that a few walking football clubs have a 'no tackling from behind' rule/law. Is this something that we should introduce? Although not all tackles from behind are bad tackles, I have accidentally injured a player with one, and I have noticed a few heavy tackles from behind by others. Something to think about, and we would like to hear your thoughts on this.


**Please note to accomodate the football on TV, the walking football will kick off at 18.30 this week (28-09-2016)**.
