Well, the site is up and running. Big thanks to Kieran Mcnairn for his extremely valuable help in putting it all together. <!--more--> The website is optimised for phone and tablet, but for the best experience, view it on a monitor.

You can also comment an any of the articles: please note that you'll need to register to comment (keeps the spammers away). You can use your Facebook, Twitter or Gmail account. Alternatively, just hit the D button and sign up to disqus.
