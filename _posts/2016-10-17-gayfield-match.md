Details need to be finalised, but we have been invited to play at Gayfield on Saturday (22nd) Oct.<!--more--> This is a chance to promote our walking football. We are to play against Carnoustie at half time. Once we know more details we will post it here. Of course, we need a team, so if you're free and available please post so here and keep looking for updates.
