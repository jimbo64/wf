![The basic rules](/assets/awf-rules.jpg)

Just to clear up a few things, here are the basic rules/laws for walking football. 

We, in Arbroath play with a below head height restriction,<!--more--> 
this based on the height of an average person. This rule/law is usualy only forced/applied indoors, but we are trying to reduce the risk of head injuries and a promote a quick. ball to feet fast passing game.

The full rules/laws can be downloaded from the link below. Just click to open. To save, right click and 'save link as'.

<strong>The rules - revisited</strong>

<strong>THE BASICS</strong>

- Minimal contact is permitted during the course of Walking Football.

Tackling, interception, blocking by standing ground, is an accepted part of the game.

Tackling from behind where contact is made; ankle-rapping from the sides, clumsy, ill-timed, forceful tackling is not an acceptable part of play and will be deemed as an infringement and dealt with by appropriate measures.

- HEAD HEIGHT RESTRICTION 


If a ball in play has been deemed to be an infringement of the head height restriction, an indirect free kick will be given to the opponents of the person that caused the ball to rise above head height by deliberate kick or a deflection off that person; to be taken from where the ball was originally kicked or in the case of a deflection, at the place where the ball last hit the person causing it to rise above the head height restriction. 

The only exception is when the ball is saved or deflected by the goalkeeper in the process of making a save. The ball shall in this instance be retained by the goalkeeper if it rises above head height.

Should a goalkeeper intentionally throw the ball or kick the ball from the penalty area and it rises above head height an indirect free kick shall be awarded to the opponents, to be taken 2 metres outside the penalty area to where the infringement occurred.

- The Kick-In.

A kick-in is a method of restarting play. It replaces the throw-in from the touchline

A goal cannot be scored directly from a kick-in

A kick-in is awarded:

when the whole of the ball passes over a touchline, either on the ground or in the air.

has to be stationary on the touchline

is kicked into play in any direction

The players of the defending team are at least 3m from the place where the kick-in is taken.



- Fouls & Misconduct (Law 12)

Only the goalkeeper is permitted in the penalty area (‘D’)

Should a defender have encroached into the penalty area – a penalty is awarded to the opposition.

Should an attacker encroach into the penalty area – an indirect free kick is awarded where the offence occurred – to be taken by the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper can only score from an indirect kick if the ball touches another player before crossing the goal line.

<strong>These are just some of the laws/rules that needed highlighting. We do hope to have referees in place for all future matches (provided we have the funds).</strong>
