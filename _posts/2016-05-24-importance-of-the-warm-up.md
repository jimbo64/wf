At the time of writing, we don't have any doctors or nurses playing with us (not like that, stop sniggering at the back), but we do have a paramedic and a couple of first aiders. 

Truth be told, we'd rather not see them being used.
One of the reasons we like to meet early, is to allow people to have a wee warm up, five - ten minutes can mean the difference between feeling fine the next day, or really struggling. 

Since we've started, I've heard of a few over-stretching injuries, these are common injuries that can be avoided.
We can't, and nor will we, force you to warm up, but it will be to your benefit if you do.
