![First-week](/assets/week1.jpg)

First week of the walking football took place tonight. Only invited players were taking part,<!--more--> this was to see how much interest there may be, and to get people used to the rules.

The venue is booked for 1 hour and the games were split into 3x20 minutes. 
Although most players hadn't played for a number of years and were generally unfit, running (on and off the ball) was initially a problem. The other problem the players had was passing the ball too far in front, in a normal game of football, this would not be a problem, however, it doesn't work in walking football. 

By the third game of the evening, most players had gotten used to the no running rule and there were some nice passing moves. One thing noted was the lack of goals scored, there were only two goals throughout the three games.
