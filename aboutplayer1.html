						<h4>Jim's story</h4>
						<p>Deepest, darkest Borneo, that's where Jim was raised by gibbons. He was always expected to be a goalkeeper (due to the length of his arms). In his younger days, he didn't fit in, but having a beard since the age of 18 months, what would you expect?</p>
						<p>He honed his 'skills' by toe poking a ball of a wall from dawn til dusk, unless he was doing the beer run for his da. School taught him one thing, that he was shite at football, but he didn't let that get in his way. He washed kits for any pub team that needed it and he'd rub liniment into players aching groins for free. His plan was to doss about until he hit 50, he passed that with flying colours. He now minces about at the walking football like his arse hairs have been tied together, "best thing that's ever happened, this walking football" he said, as he minced past.</p>
						<p>This could be you!</p>
